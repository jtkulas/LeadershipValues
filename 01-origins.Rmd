The idea behind this project originated with consideration of Aristotle's perspective regarding balance, specifically with regard to the "golden mean". This is a moral location between excess and deficiency. 

Currently the project aims to develop a 360$^{\circ}$ instrument that can be applied to leaders, which delivers feedback along leadership-relevant but philosophically- and spiritually-derived values and virtues.  

+ leadership-relevant
